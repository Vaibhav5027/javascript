/* thre are two types of memory STACK and HEAP



all the primitive(string,number,null,undefined,bigint,symbol,boolean) datatypes are stored in stack memory 
and other non-primitive(array,object,function) datatypes are stored on heap meamory

if you assign the variable to another varible and after that you made some changes on this then it will not 
reflect in first varible

for exapme==>
    let name=vaibhav;
let newname=name;
newname="sham";
it will not affect the name vaiable name varible stiil have the value vaibhav  ,,

but this is not case in non primituve datatpes
